By default ip helper-address will forward broadcasts for these protocols:
UDP 69 (TFTP)
UDP 53 (DNS)
UDP 37 (time service)
UDP 137 (NetBIOS Name Server)
UDP 138 (NetBIOS Datagram Server)
UDP 67 and 68 (BOOTP client and server/DHCP)
UDP 49 (TACACS)
UDP 116 (Name Service).
Additional protocols can be enabled for forwarding using the command ip forward-protocol.


for DHCP ip helper-address will take the DHCP request from the client and forward it (unchanged) to the DHCP server.
DHCP relay the router receives the DHCP request from the client and builds a new request to send to the server (which gives the router an opportunity to add information in the request about the router).
